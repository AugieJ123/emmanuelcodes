            <p>Physics department is under the faculty of pure and applied sciences at Fourah Bay College.</p>
            <p>The physics department is led by either a Professor or an academic Dr which is regarded as the head of department followed by the departmental admin, senior lecturers and junior staffs.</p>
            <p>The physics department building was name after a grate particle physicist by the name of Prof Godwin whose immaculate journey started at the said department.
